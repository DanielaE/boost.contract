Design By Contract for C++ (DBC++)
==================================

The DBC++ library supports Design By Contract (DBC) for the C++ programming 
language.

Essentially, all Eiffel programming language DBC features are supported by 
DBC++. Among others:
1)  "old" prefix in postconditions;
2)  Subcontracting;
3)  Optional contract compilation;
4)  Full integration with Doxygen.

IMPORTANT:  The library is still under development, its API should be 
            considered experimental and subject to change.

The documentation is yet to be written. Please look at the examples in the
"example/" directory for illustrations on how to use the library.

Run `make' to see how to build examples, test, install, etc.

The library requires the C++ Boost library http://www.boost.org/. In particular
Boost.Preprocessor and Boost.MPL are required.
