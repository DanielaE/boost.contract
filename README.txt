Boost.Contract

This library implements Contract Programming (a.k.a., Design by Contract or DbC)
for the C++ programming language.

All Contract Programming features are supported by this library: subcontracting,
class invariants, postconditions (with old and return values), preconditions,
customizable actions on assertion failure (terminate, throw, etc.), optional
compilation of assertion checking, disable assertion checking while already
checking other assertions (to avoid infinite recursion), etc.
