*   Recompile all examples/tests with all compilers, boost_contract_no, link, boost_contract_header_only, etc. (after fully integrated w/ Boost build system)

*   Check all warnings
    **  msvc, gcc, clang
    **  only for example/features and build/ -a
    **  only for all_yes and all_no bc_no combinations
    **  for link=shared,static and bc_hdr=only
    **  only from this lib (grep away all warning from boost::shared_ptr, etc.)

*   Compile with cxxstd=03 (maybe just examples and tests shared,static,hdr_only with all_yes and all_no, but not all other bc_no combinations)
