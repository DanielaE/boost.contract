Features to test:

x   Constructors w/ subcontracting
    --> pre > bases' pre > for x in [bases, class] ( static_inv (but not inv) > body > static_inv > inv > post )
    --> protected and private bases ALSO contract (because always part of C++ obj construction mechanism)
x   Constructor preconditions checked before member initialization list
x   Constructors have no `.precondition` (must use `constructor_precondition` instead)

x   Destructors subcontracting (w/ postconditions)
    --> for x in [class, reverse(bases)] ( static_inv > inv > body > static_inv (but not inv) > post )
    --> protected and private bases ALSO contract (because always part of C++ obj destructor mechanism)
x   Destructors have no `.precondition` (because destructors have no argument)

*   Private members check pre and post, but no cv/static invariants and no subcontracting
*   Private members above w/ bind

*   Protected members check pre and post, but no cv/static invariants and no subcontracting
*   Protected members above w/ bind

*   Static public members check pre, post, and static invariants, but no cv invariants and no subcontracting
*   Static public members above w/ bind

*   Public members subcontracting
    --> pre in logic-or
    --> post and inv in logic-and
    --> protected and private bases do not subcontract

x   Free functions pre and post (but obviously no cv/static invariants and no subcontracting)
x   Check (just for free functions, other contract use same set_... classes anyways) that:
    OK:     nothing | pre (only) | post (only) | pre > post | post > pre
    Error:  pre > pre | post > post | pre > post > pre | post > pre > post

x   Old values with/without subcontracting
    --> copied and evaluated only once by OLDOF
*   Result... by ref so never copied
*   Result as boost::optional... by ref so never copied
*   On body throw... for all contract types
*   Throw from contract (non-contract exception)
*   Failure handlers and throw on contract failure
*   Disable pre, post, and/or entry/exit inv (all combinations)
*   Contracts disabled while checking contracts...
*   Overloading for all contracts
*   Volatile inv
*   No static inv / const inv / volatile inv when static_inv / inv const / inv const volatile func not defined (for ctor, dtor, and pub member)
