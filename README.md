Boost.Contract
==============

Contract programming for C++.
All contract programming features are supported: subcontracting, class invariants (also static and volatile), postconditions (with old and return values), preconditions, customizable actions on assertion failure (terminate, throw, etc.), optional compilation and checking of assertions, disable assertions while already checking other assertions (to avoid infinite recursion), etc.
