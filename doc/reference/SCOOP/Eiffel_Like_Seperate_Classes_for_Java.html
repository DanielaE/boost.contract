<h1>Eiffel-Like Separate Classes</h1>

<div class="storybody">

  <p>
<i>
To extend Java's concurrent behavior in a more natural way, in a more
object-oriented point of view, we propose an extension to Java's
concurrency model that will emulate Eiffel's separate statement.
(Eiffel is an object-oriented language with a comprehensive approach to
software construction.) The extension permits the attachment of
nonphysical processors or threads to objects, thus allowing them to
behave in an asynchronous and completely independent manner. This
article briefly shows the concurrency tools of the Java programming
language, points out their shortcomings, proposes solutions, and ends
with the implementation of a solution.</i>
</p><p> It's useful to evaluate Java's concurrent programming model by
reviewing how this language implements the concepts explained by
Bertrand Meyer and referred to as "The three forces of computation,"
which represent the statement: "To perform a computation is to use
certain processors to apply certain actions to certain objects." </p><p> Java classes and objects play the same role in Eiffel as they
do in Java. In Java the notion of a nonphysical processor fits in with
the concept of thread as represented by the Thread class. A processor
would then represent an autonomous thread of control that's capable of
supporting the sequential execution of instructions on one or more
objects.
</p><p> Differences arise when we look at the possible assignment of
processors to actions. In Java we have only the run() method, which
belongs to the Runnable interface, for concurrent execution. This
interface must be implemented by a class attached to a Thread instance
in construction time and then, and only then, can we explicitly start
the thread's execution, employing the technique known as delegation.
</p><p> The problem originates from the fact that threads and objects
represent different entities - methods run on threads, objects do not -
so the only way to get a method to run concurrently (in an independent
thread) is to call it from inside that thread's run() method. This is a
disadvantage of this model since the object technology's basic model
for computation would somehow be broken, as we can easily conclude from
the following statement:
</p><p>
<font color="maroon">
objRef.operID(args);
</font></p><p> Here the execution of method operID(), called as part of
an action performed on a client object, won't occur concurrently as
long as it's not placed inside a thread's run() method. The model is
said to be broken since there's no natural, object-oriented way in Java
to provoke the attachment of different streams of execution to both the
client object and objRef. The entire class design should be oriented to
the implementation of the Runnable interface and the creation of Thread
class instances. <br>	
	Figure 1 shows, in UML notation, a possible general pattern for this problem.</p><p>
The benefits of this mechanism are based on the fact that Java clearly
separates the notion of data abstraction, implemented by classes, from
the notion of control, represented by the framework that's composed of
the Thread and ThreadGroup classes and the Runnable interface. Table 1
shows the main components of this framework.<br>	
	Once this model has been analyzed, let's proceed with Eiffel's concurrency model.

</p><p>
<b>A Closer Look at Eiffel's Model</b><br> We'll now analyze Eiffel by
looking for features that are capable of improving the former
concurrency model. According to Meyer: "... any object O2 is handled by
a certain processor, its handler; the handler is responsible for
executing all calls on O2 (all calls of the form x.f (a) where x is
attached to O2)." </p><p>
	From this statement we can conclude that the proposed model has two different call semantics:
</p><ul>
<li>	Synchronous: The client object will be forced to wait for the server to complete its operation, as requested in the code.
</li><li> Asynchronous: An object doesn't need to wait for the others
to proceed with its execution, since it occurs in different processors.
</li></ul>
<p> In Java the default semantic is obviously synchronous. It doesn't
provide any syntactic construction in its classes that will specify a
different processor for its methods. So we need to define asynchronous
execution through the use of Thread instances and the method run. This
is the only way to define an asynchronous split of control.</p><p>
<b>Defining Separate Entities in Java: </b><br>
<b>A Straightforward Implementation</b><br> The essential difference
between sequential and concurrent execution of actions is that the
handler of the call's target is different from the one that originated
the call. Doug Lea's interactive diagrams show this difference with
solid and dashed lines that represent synchronous and asynchronous
method calls. Figure 2 depicts such an interactive diagram for the
pattern in Figure 1.</p><p>
To implement this difference in Java, we'll follow Eiffel's approach,
which allows us to define separate entities in two ways. The first one
permits the creation of an object's instance and attaches it as an
independent processor.
</p><p>
<font color="maroon">
x: separate A
</font>
</p><p>
	Here we're declaring an object x, instance of class A, that you'd execute on a different processor.
</p><p> The second approach takes a static form and is applicable when
all the instances of a class are intended to be separate entities:
</p><p>
<font color="maroon">
separate class A ...
</font>
</p><p> We cover both forms in this article. Our semantics require a
new processor to handle all the messages for each of the instances of
our separate classes or objects. </p><p> Obviously, we need to modify the Java syntax, adding a new
keyword as an optional modifier in class and field definitions. To
accomplish this, a preprocessing approach is proposed. This means that
a parser program should be developed for parsing the Java source file
and eliminate, if included, the separate modifier and replace it with
some standard code. </p><p> The following is our first approach to the problem, but not
the best one. We'll add some code before any invocation to a public
method, and in separate-declared classes replace every method's body
with code that's responsible for the creation of a new thread and the
execution of its run() method. Inside this method we'll select the
original code and invoke it. That's not the exact semantic of separate
in Eiffel, but it provides us with a good place to start our
evaluation. Since we need to intercept method invocation, we use the
Java Reflection API.
</p><p>
<b>Java Tools for the Solution</b><br> The Reflection API is composed
of a set of classes that enable us to discover information about Java
classes at runtime. This new feature of Java, developed with version
1.1 of the JDK, has also been called the introspection API because it
gives objects the ability to look inside themselves or other classes
during runtime.
</p><p>
	The API defines the following elements:
</p><ul>
<li>	At the core of the API is an object called Class for reflecting classes and interfaces in a running Java application.
</li><li> Every object has a constructor, can perform a set of actions
(also called methods), and is characterized through a number of
attributes or variables. All these components are reflected through the
Constructor, Method, and Field objects in the API that permit us to
obtain information about each object's elements according to the
security police used.
</li><li> The Member interface, implemented by the three former
objects, contains the prototypes of methods that allow you to query the
object's members.
</li><li> To represent primitive Java data types, the API contains
nine Class objects defined as constants such as java.lang.Boolean.TYPE
and java.lang.Character.TYPE.
</li><li> There are two utility classes: Array and Modifier. The
former allows us to access and construct Java arrays dynamically; the
latter helps to decode language modifiers on classes and members.
</li></ul>
<br>	
	Let's now proceed with our desired output definition on the basis of these elements.

<p>
<b>Implementing the Solution</b><br>
<b>Separate as a Class Modifier</b><br> Let's now define how our
solution should work, what we need as input data, and what we should
produce. First we have a class like the one in Listing 1. After
preprocessing, we obtain the code in Listing 2.
</p><p>
	Two things must be taken into account:<br>
	</p><ol>
<li>The security police used
</li><li>The methods' formal parameters
 </li></ol>
 <p> The security
police that are used could affect the way we obtain the original method
references, the one we invoke later in method run(). In Listing 1 we
defined the method m2() as public, since the getMethod() method just
returns Method objects that reflect the specified public member of the
class. To obtain a reference to members affected by private-,
protected-, or default-access modifiers, like m1(), for example, we can
take one of the two approaches listed below: </p><ol>	

<li>We can use the getDeclaredMethod(...) method instead of
getMethod(), which can throw a security exception when a security
manager is installed.
</li><li>As in Listing 2, the original modifiers on the methods
generated by the preprocessing parser, m1() and m2(), remain untouched,
and the original programmer's methods in the generated code, orig_m1()
and orig_m2(), get declared public. This approach shouldn't affect the
security of the application, since orig_m1() and orig_m2() are
completely new for the program and invocations on them don't exist.
</li></ol>
<p> The second item to take into account is the methods' formal
parameter treatment that must be done. The reflection API allows us to
refer them at runtime through an array of Object instances, the
__params variable used in Listing 2. Because of this, you shouldn't
declare any parameter belonging to some of Java's primitive types.
Instead we propose the use of the corresponding wrapper classes found
in the java.lang package such as Integer, Float, and Double.
</p><p>
<b>Separate as a Modifier for Class Fields</b><br> This solution is a
little bit trickier since we'll find situations where the object's
instances should run in their own thread and others where this behavior
won't be needed.
</p><p> To accomplish this, we've implemented the desired output in an
inner class whose role is to permit the execution of each method's
invocation in an object's thread. We use the starting code in Listing
3, then after preprocessing we should obtain the code in Listing 4.
</p><p> As you can see, the changes affect classes A and B. The _Aux
class in A encapsulates the behavior to execute in the separate case.
Each invocation of m1() in B should be replaced with a separate_m1().
</p><p> Another detail to take into account is the use of the
getDeclaredMethod() method, instead of the getMethod() mentioned
earlier, for taking a reference to the method that will be invoked. The
main reason behind this decision is that we're invoking methods of A
from class B, so we can't make them all of public type.
</p><p> One more thing: the solution of encapsulating the separate
behavior in an inner class is perfectly portable to the first analyzed
case. The difference is just in the semantics of the problem. </p><p>
<b>Implementing the Preprocessing Parser</b><br>
	Traditionally, as everyone knows, a parser is a tool capable of performing three basic tasks:
</p><ol>
<li>It receives some text from an input source, a Java program, for example.
</li><li>The text has to be organized according to some predefined criteria.
</li><li>Some actions have to be performed on this input based upon the above-generated organization.
</li></ol>
<p> The first two tasks are frequently encompassed and performed by an
auxiliary application named scanner. Its main objective consists of
building high-level language units called tokens, while discarding
constructs that don't represent any useful information, such as white
spaces and comments. Figure 3 depicts this functionality.
</p><p> The actions mentioned in Step 3 try to match the tokens
generated by the scanner against a language specification. If this
match becomes successful, the parser then performs some action upon the
construct. In our case it could generate the code that implements the
separate behavior.
</p><p> Building a parser from the ground up is a highly complex and
time-consuming task. We used a parser generator, namely Sun's Java
Compiler Compiler version 1.0, or JavaCC, which can be freely
downloaded from Sun's Web site or from Metamata.com. The last one
offers the parser generator and a set of example grammars. </p><p> A parser generator is usually a tool that's capable of
generating parser and scanner programs starting from a grammar
specification of the language to one we want to parse. The Java grammar
we used was one of the samples that ships with JavaCC from
Metamata.com, which covers Java's 1.1 language extensions.
</p><p> JavaCC is based on ANTLR technology; also, it is an LL(k)
predicate-based parser generator. It is beyond the intention of this
article to describe in depth the details of the parser generator's
algorithms. The interested reader should note the references at the end
of this article.
</p><p>
<b>Changes to the Java Input Grammar</b><br> To correctly parse a Java
program whose objects can be affected by the separate modifier, first
modify the Java grammar that's used as input for the generation of the
parser and scanner tools. For this purpose there are only a few
elements to modify from the original grammar construct:
</p><ul>
<li>	The set of reserved words and literals that have to include the token separately
</li><li>	The set of class and class field modifiers that allow separate to be a valid modifier for both elements
</li></ul>
<p> These changes are very simple since the specification language to
build the input description is Java-based with a few extensions to
specify grammars (see Listings 5 and 6).
</p><p> Note: There's a special method for analyzing a class field,
instead of a general method for fields belonging to classes or
interfaces. That's because the interface's fields may not be declared
separate.
</p><p>
<b>Output Generation</b><br> The generation of the output code, in case
of separate behavior, is straightforward. In the JavaParser class
generated by JavaCC, when the separate modifier is found, we start
storing the class elements defined by the programmer since the parser
just analyzes language units, eliminating the separate token. At the
end of this analysis the stored code is added to the one needed for
separate behavior, which is generated by the class JavaParserNewCode. </p><p> To accomplish this generation, the only things to take into
account are the method definitions, since separate behavior consists
only of executing every method invocation in its own processor.
</p><p>

<b>JVM Scheduling vs Eiffel's Concurrency Control Files</b><br> We've
defined processors as abstract concepts, independent of the underlying
hardware and operating system architectures. In doing so, we've
achieved a desirable independence for physical details. Our object
system can run on a single processor workstation with a time-sharing
schedule or in an SMP server.
</p><p> Eventually we need to assign our physical resources to the
processors of our program. In Eiffel we have the Concurrency Control
File as a mechanism for defining this mapping. </p><p> In Java it's impossible to define such things
programmatically. Threads are created dynamically in runtime as any
other object, and the scheduling is left to the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM). We can use groups of threads and priorities to obtain some level
of control over the execution of threads, but the core algorithm is
embedded in the JVM and, in current versions of the JDK, it's not
possible to customize or substitute. In fact, it's somewhat
implementation-defined (as noted in earlier versions of JDK, Solaris
and Windows implementations differ in that the first is not
preemptive). </p><p> In Java, distributed programming uses an additional API,
called RMI, for communicating remote JVMs via remote interfaces.
Alternatively, we can use IDL and CORBA. </p><p> The JVM is an operating system process in current commercial
OSs, so they're under control of the OS process control. We haven't
heard about parallel implementations of the JVM, exploiting the runtime
information about threads, but it's clear that it would be advantageous
to obtain better performance in architectures that include
multiprocessing.
</p><p>
<b>Conclusion</b><br> We've described our experiences and related
studies regarding the introduction of Eiffel's concurrency model into
Java. Our goal has been to extend Java's concurrent programming
capabilities with the creation of completely independent objects
through the use of a separate modifier. </p><p> Our approach helped us to unify, in some way, the notion of
objects and threads, giving a more consistent object-oriented view to
the design and implementation of concurrent applications in Java. The
newly introduced model keeps the conceptual architecture strictly
separate from the physical one; the former assumes that there'll be as
many resources as the application needs; the latter is responsible for
the creation of threads and their assignation to separate objects.
</p><p> Another benefit to this approach is applicable to the academic
field; we've taught Concurrent Java Design for three years and lacked a
uniform object-oriented-based vision of the problem. With our
extension, the design of concurrent Java applications is divided into
two stages. The first is based on objects that are affected by the
separate clause in which we apply the usual object-oriented execution
mechanism of object.operation(args) and introduce the concurrency
concepts in a more natural way. In the second stage we present Java's
concurrency tools in more detail, going deeper into its mechanism and
behavior. </p><p> Through this division, new concepts become simpler and more
natural for the student since the move from sequential to concurrent
programming just represents, initially, a little change in processor
assignation. </p><p> One problem is the management of distributed resources. In
Eiffel resources are mapped to processors through the Concurrency
Control File, which enables you to manage the allocation of local and
remote resources to processes. This unified view of mapping creates a
better plan for running threads, allowing applications to control the
physical allocation. The only ways for thread control in Java are, as
mentioned previously, the Thread and ThreadGroup classes and the
methods inherited from the Object class. These elements have to be
combined with the functionality contained in the RMI package when we're
developing distributed multithreaded applications. This makes this work
error-prone and creates hard-to-predict client machine dependencies.
Hence, we're preparing an extension of Java's thread control
capabilities with support for distributed resources management. </p><p>
